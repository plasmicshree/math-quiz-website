🚀 QUICK START - Math Quiz Website
====================================

⚠️  CRITICAL: ALWAYS USE TWO SEPARATE TERMINALS!

Terminal 1 - BACKEND:
  cd e:\math_webpage\math_quiz_website; .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; cd backend; python app.py
  → http://127.0.0.1:5000
  (Look for: "Loaded 50 addition templates" + "Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000")

Terminal 2 - FRONTEND:
  cd e:\math_webpage\math_quiz_website; .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; cd frontend; python -m http.server 8000
  → http://localhost:8000 (open in browser)
  (Look for: "Serving HTTP on :: port 8000")

Terminal 3+ - GIT/COMMANDS:
  cd e:\math_webpage\math_quiz_website
  git status, git commit, etc.
